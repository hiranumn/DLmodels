# Implementation of 3D generative models

## 3D convolutional variational autoencoder (3dVAE)

Features:
    - 4 convolution and 4 transposed convolutions
    - customizable latent dimention (latent_dim=200 as default)
    - batch normalization
    
Usage: See the notebook: 3D-Conv-VAE implementation (ModelNet Chair example)

Sample results:
    - coming soon...

## 3D Generative Adversarial Network (3dGAN)

This is based on the 3DGAN paper from NIPS 2016 (http://3dgan.csail.mit.edu/papers/3dgan_nips.pdf)

Features:
